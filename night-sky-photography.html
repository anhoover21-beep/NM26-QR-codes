🌌 Night Sky Photography Tips

(Dark desert skies + waning crescent moon = perfect conditions)



1, Stabilize Your Phone

Use a small tripod or

Prop against a rock, backpack, cooler, or camper roof

The phone must remain still

 Movement = streaks and blur


2, Turn Off Flash

You’re capturing ancient light.
Flash ruins it instantly.


3. Enable Night Mode / Long Exposure

Most phones now support:

Night Mode

Star Mode

Long Exposure


4. Let the phone work for you.

Tap to Focus (on a star)

Tap the brightest star and hold to lock focus.

5. Lower Exposure

Slide exposure down slightly. Reduces blown-out sky haze.





6. Do NOT Zoom

Zoom adds noise. Move your body instead.


7. Breathe Control

When you tap the shutter:

Hold your breath

Don’t shift your weight

Don’t touch the tripod


8. Include Foreground

Add:

A silhouette cactus

Car roof

Person standing still

Rock or ridge line


Foreground anchors the photo.


9. Aim Southeast After 10:00 PM

June skies reveal the Milky Way core in the southeast. This is the best direction for galaxy shots.


10. Shoot Satellite Trails

Long exposure will catch:

Straight lines = satellites

Quick, tapered lines = meteors

You’ll capture at least one.



11. Try Silhouette Portraits

Place a lantern behind the subject:

Aim phone at the stars

Hold still 6–10 seconds. You get a glowing outline + star field.


12. Manual Settings (If Available)

Shutter: 6–20 sec

ISO: 400–1600

Focus: ∞ (Infinity)

White Balance: 4000–4500K


13. RAW Format (Bonus)

If your phone allows RAW: Use it. You can brighten shadows without adding noise.


Composition Tips

Horizon on bottom third

Center the Milky Way “river”

Scorpius + Sagittarius look GREAT in frame


Pro Tip

Your camera sees stars your eyes can’t.
